All courses have either fixed predefined agenda or can have individual scope depending on your specific needs. They can be tailored for beginners, skilled programmers or focused just on specific topics. Everyone will finish training with some form of takeaway. Beginners will be able to immediately work with given technology, advanced programmers will have clear inside view and will be able to use more complex statements and architectural patterns.
